# THE CITY's Multi-page React Template for News Apps

[THE CITY](https://www.thecity.nyc/pages/about) is a nonprofit, nonpartisan, digital newsroom dedicated to hard-hitting reporting that serves the people of New York. We publish news apps and data graphics regularly, and we try and open source as much of our code as we can so that others can use it. You can check out a list of our recent projects on [THE CITY Projects Page](https://projects.thecity.nyc/all-projects/).

This template is what we use to create multi-page interactive projects, and it is bootstrapped with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/?utm_source=starter&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=minimal-starter). The deployment process is based in part on the [Baker Rig](https://github.com/datadesk/baker) project by the L.A. Times.

## 🚀 Getting started

The first step is to click GitHub’s “use this template” button to a make a copy of the repository for yourself.

![](./.github/images/use-this-template.png)

You’ll be asked to provide a slug for your project. Once that’s done, a new repository will be available at `https://github.com/your-username/your-slug`.

Next you’ll need to clone it down to your computer to work with the code.

Open up your terminal and cd to your code folder. Clone the project into your folder. This will copy the project onto your computer.

```sh
gh repo clone https://github.com/your-username/your-slug
```

Once the repository has finished downloading, cd into your-slug and install the Node.js dependencies.

```sh
npm install
```

Once the dependencies have been installed, you’re ready to preview the project. Run the following to start the test server.

```sh
npm start
```

Now go to `localhost:8000` in your browser. You should see a boilerplate page ready for your customizations.

## Using this template

This code is free and open source and you are permitted to use for your own projects under the [Apache 2.0 License](LICENSE) included in this repository. However, before deploying anything publicly using this codebase, you must:

- Change [`_fonts/scss`](src/styles/_fonts.scss) — our fonts are proprietary and are not permitted for use outside of THE CITY's domain. Please change these fonts to ones you own publishing rights to, or use free, web-safe fonts instead.
- Remove [`logo.svg`](src/assets/images/logo.svg) — our logo is trademarked and cannot be used without THE CITY's explicit permission. Please remove this logo [from the header](src/components/PageLayout.tsx), or swap in your own logo.

Also, as part of our license, we require that any online publication of work built using this software **include a credit and
link to THE CITY**. The template includes the suggested sentence “Made with ♥ in NYC by THE CITY” in the page footer — feel free to leave that in.

Lastly, we want to hear from you! We'd love to know if you are using this code to publish your own projects. Drop us a line at [data@thecity.nyc](mailto:data@thecity.nyc).

## Deploying to AWS

We've set up automatic deployment to AWS S3 based on the [Baker Rig](https://github.com/datadesk/baker) project by the L.A. Times. See these instructions on how to set that up:

### Configuring your account

Before you can deploy an app created by this repository, you will need to configure your Amazon AWS account and add a set of credentials to your GitHub account.

First, you'll need to create two buckets in Amazon's S3 storage service. One is for your staging site. The other is for your production site. For this simple example, each should allow public access and be [configured to serve a static website](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/HostingWebsiteOnS3Setup.html).

The names of those buckets should then be stored as GitHub "secrets" accessible to the Actions that deploy the site. You should visit [your settings panel for your account or organization](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-an-organization). Start by adding these two secrets.

| Name                       | Value                                                  |
| :------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| `AWS_S3_STAGING_BUCKET`    | The name of your staging bucket                        |
| `AWS_S3_STAGING_REGION`    | The S3 region where your staging bucket was created    |
| `AWS_S3_PRODUCTION_BUCKET` | The name of your production bucket                     |
| `AWS_S3_PRODUCTION_REGION` | The S3 region where your production bucket was created |

Next you should ensure that you have an key pair from AWS that has the ability to upload public files to your two buckets. The values should also be added to your secrets.

| Name                    | Value              |
| :---------------------- | :----------------- |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`     | The AWS access key |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | The AWS secret key |

### Optional configurations

You can set up a [CloudFront distribution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-working-with.html) on AWS for both your staging and production buckets — during deployment, Github Actions will invalidate the old distribution to refresh the cache for your site.

Once you create your distributions, copy the distribution IDs and store them as GitHub "secrets" accessible to the Actions that deploy the site.

| Name                                  | Value                                         |
| :------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------- |
| `AWS_STAGING_CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION` | The distribution ID for the staging bucket    |
| `AWS_CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION`         | The distribution ID for the production bucket |

### Staging your work

[A GitHub Action](https://github.com/datadesk/baker-example-page-template/actions/workflows/deploy-stage.yml) included with this repository will automatically publish a staging version for every branch. For instance, code pushed to the default `main` branch will appear at `https://your-staging-bucket-url/your-repo/main/`.

If you were to create a new git branch called `bugfix` and push your code, you would soon see a new staging version at `https://your-staging-bucket-url/your-repo/bugfix/`.

### Publishing your work

Before you send your page live, you should settle on a final slug for the URL. This will set the subdirectory in your bucket where the page will be published. This feature allows The Times to publish numerous pages inside the same bucket with each page managed by a different repository.

Step one is to enter the slug for your URL into the `.env` configuration file.

```yaml
GATSBY_SLUG: your-page-slug
```

You should also set the domain within the `.env` configuration file to match your production bucket url.

```yaml
GATSBY_DOMAIN: https://your-production-bucket-url/
```

It’s never a bad idea to make sure your slug hasn’t already been taken. You can do that by visiting `https://your-production-bucket-url/your-slug/` and ensuring it returns a page not found error.

Next you commit your change to the configuration file and make sure it’s pushed to the main branch on GitHub.

Visit the releases section of your repository’s page on GitHub. You can find it on the repo’s homepage.

Draft a new release.

There you’ll create a new tag number. A good approach is to start with an x.x.x format number that follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) standards. 1.0.0 is a fine start.

Finally, hit the big green button at the bottom and send out the release.

Wait a few minutes and your page should show up at `https://your-production-bucket-url/your-slug/`.
